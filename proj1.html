    <p>When I was 5, I have a very vivid memory of watching my grandpa on the computer. Ever since we had gotten a desktop, he would be on it almost all the time. I didn't understand why, at first, until I watched him one day. To my surprise, he was playing mahjong. While I found it boring at first, I soon came to understand why he was so enamored with the internet. The colors, the connections he made with other players, it was all exciting and new for him. Thinking back, I realize it was a new experience for the both of us despite the significant age gap. While he was experiencing the newness of the internet at the end of his life, I was experiencing it at the beginning of mine.</p>
